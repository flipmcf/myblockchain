Thank you first to Daniel van Flymen author of https://hackernoon.com/learn-blockchains-by-building-one-117428612f46


 "Remember that a blockchain is an immutable, sequential chain of records called Blocks."

And anythign can be in that record.  Most are familliar with a transaction, or more specifically,
a transaction of bitcoin from one account to another, but that's only one use of the data structure.

Bitcoin Transactions are to Blockchain as integers are to linked lists.  

each block is chained to the next one using a hash.
